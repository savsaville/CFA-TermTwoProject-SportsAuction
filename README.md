# GRASSROOTS



# As a Class Project for CFA we were given the task to create a two sided market place using Ruby on Rails. This was to appeal to one of three people where we would imagine pitching the idea:
  - Barack Obama
   - Rupert Murdoch
   - Bill and Melinda Gates

These were the following deliverables:

# Design Documentation
  -  Demonstrate your ability to break down the problem and design a solution.
  -  One page summary of your application including problem definition, solution.
  -  A workflow diagram of the user journey/s.
  -  Wireframes for at least 5 screens.
  -  User stories for the whole application.
  -  Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD).
  -  Project plan and estimation.
  -  Tools and methodologies
  -  Trello or similar project management tool to be used to track progress of build.
  -  Code review. Demonstrate that you have had your code reviewed by other students and that    you have provided a code review for others.
  -  Github. Demonstrate use of frequent commits, pull requests, documentation.
  -  Use Agile development methodologies.
  -  Provide evidence you have used code quality tools (eg. Traceroute, Bullet, Brakeman,       -  Rails Best Practices tool, RuboCop, RubyCritic, CodeClimate).

# Rails application code
   - Demonstrate Ruby on Rails development skills.
-    Create your application using Ruby on Rails.
-    Demonstrate knowledge of Rails conventions.
-    Use postgresql database in development.
-    Use an API (eg. Omniauth, Geocoding, Maps, other..).
-    Use appropriate gems.
-    Use environmental variables to protect API keys etc.
-    Implement a payment system for your product *
 -   Your app must send transactional emails (eg. using Mailgun).
 -   Your app should have an internal user messaging system.
 -   Your app will have some type of searching, sorting and or filtering capability.
 -   Your app will have some type of file uploading capability (eg. images).
 -   Your app will have authentication (eg. Devise, must have full functionality in place).
 -   Your app will have authorisation (users have restrictions on what they can see and edit).
 -   Your app will have an admin dashboard for the admin user to administrate the site.
 -   Document your application with a README that explains how to setup, configure and use            your application.
 -   The core functionality of your application needs to be tested with Rspec.
 -   Deployed application
 -   Your application is to be deployed to Heroku.
 -   Your deployed application must have data present to show functionality.

 #   Presentation
  -  You are to deliver a 7 minute presentation to the class.
  -  The presentation should include:
  -  A Walk-through of your design decisions and documents
  -  A review of your build process - challenges, favourite parts
  -  A walk-through of your live app and pointing out its features
  -  Answer any questions from students or teachers.

# Ideation

I started with a few different ideas and and tried to link them back to Maslows triangle. After taking a few ideas down I settled on to the main two, both of these were related to sport and both related to coaching and development of children.

The problem I identified was that in a broad sense, there is a severe lack of participation among kids around Australia in sporting activity, especially in a structured way. This has a myriad of knock on effects, including academic performance and health concerns, as well as a financial burden later on when the top teams are not performing.
I wanted to build a platform that enabled established stars to give back to their roots and help out the young boys and girls that are currently thinking about getting into sport. The idea is that they would donate their time and merchandise and auction them off on GrassRoots. The money would then go to a designated charity or cause.
I have seen firsthand the positive effects that sport can have on kids once they are able to play and have fun in a structured format. This will allow kids who are not as fortunate as others to be able to participate.
It will also be an opportunity to promote individuals and their sports as the goodwill generated will be a huge boost for everyone.

Build Issues

The auction part of the application was the hardest to do as it involved various components and there was very little documentation to follow. THat was easily my favourite thing though along with the API that converts currencies.
The other various rails implementations all had there challenges but it was not until the design that I had trouble.
